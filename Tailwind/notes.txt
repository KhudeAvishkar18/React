Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

For Installation of Tailwind in React - 

>npm create vite@latest my-project
>cd my-project
>npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
>npm install


Paste below content in vite.config.js file

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
})


Then import Tailwind css inside index.css file
@import "tailwindcss";

Then to run react app enter below command in console
>npm run dev

Note : If any error comes in installation, follow official documentation or ask chatgpt



Actual CSS classes -


To make any element center, use 'grid' class in that element
To make it center vertically & horizontally - 'place-content-center'

To increase height of any element equals to height of viewport - 'h-screen'



By default Tailwind uses mobile first approach for responsiveness, we have to convert it for large display device
